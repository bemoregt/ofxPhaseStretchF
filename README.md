### Copy Right
Although I developed this implementation, the algorithm was developed and first implemented in MatLab at the Jalali Lab at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). PST is a spin-off from research on the photonic time stretch technique done at this lab. More information about the technique can be found on the group's website.

This function is provided for research purposes only. A license must be obtained from the University of California, Los Angeles for any commercial applications. The algorithm is protected under a US patent.
